### **Comprehensive Summary of the Research Document**

#### **1. Research Objective**
- **Main Research Question/Hypothesis**:
  The study investigates whether the **narrow debris disc around Fomalhaut** could be dominated by **primordial Pluto-sized bodies (R ≈ 1000 km)** or if dynamical constraints limit the maximum size of the largest planetesimals. The key hypothesis is that **if the disc were too massive or contained overly large bodies, self-scattering would broaden it beyond observed limits**.

- **Problem Addressed**:
  - **Debris-disc mass problem**: Observations only detect small (cm-sized) dust, but the **true mass is dominated by unseen large planetesimals**. Extrapolating dust masses to large bodies (e.g., Plutos) yields implausibly high total masses (>1000 M⊕), exceeding protoplanetary disc solid inventories.
  - **Lack of direct constraints**: No method exists to measure the **sizes of the largest debris bodies** or **total disc mass** without relying on uncertain size-distribution extrapolations.
  - **Fomalhaut’s narrow disc**: Its **well-resolved, eccentric, and narrow structure** (width ~10–15 AU) provides a testbed for dynamical constraints on mass and body sizes.

#### **2. Methodology**
- **Research Methods**:
  1. **N-body Simulations**:
     - Modeled the **dynamical evolution** of Fomalhaut’s disc under self-gravity, varying:
       - **Total disc mass** (M_disc).
       - **Size of the largest planetesimals** (R_max).
     - Tracked how **self-scattering** broadens the disc over time.
  2. **Analytic Theory**:
     - Derived a **scaling relation** for disc broadening due to gravitational stirring by large bodies.
     - Combined with **collisional cascade models** to link dynamical stirring to observable disc width.
  3. **Collisional Physics**:
     - Incorporated **collisional damping** (small grains dampening eccentricities) and **shepherding planets** (though found to be negligible for Fomalhaut).

- **Key Technical Approaches**:
  - **Dynamical Timescale Analysis**: Compared the **disc’s age (440 Myr)** to the **timescale for self-broadening** to exceed observed width.
  - **Mass–Size Constraints**: Used the condition that the disc **must not have scattered beyond its current width** to derive upper limits on M_disc and R_max.
  - **Robustness Checks**: Tested additional physics (e.g., gas drag, planetary perturbations) to ensure conclusions held.

#### **3. Key Findings**
- **Primary Results**:
  - **Fomalhaut’s disc cannot be dominated by Pluto-sized bodies**:
    - If the mass were dominated by **primordial Plutos (R ≈ 1000 km)**, the disc would have **scattered to a much broader width** than observed within 440 Myr.
  - **Constraints on Largest Body Sizes**:
    - The largest primordial bodies must have radii in the range:
      **5–300 km** (best-fit: **~50–200 km**, or **0.05–0.2 R_Pluto**).
    - Each body would have **<1% of Pluto’s mass**.
  - **Total Disc Mass Limit**:
    - The disc mass must be **≤ a few hundred M⊕** (far below the >1000 M⊕ implied by naive dust extrapolations).

- **Supporting Evidence**:
  - **N-body Simulations**: Showed that discs with **R_max > 300 km** broaden beyond observations within the system’s age.
  - **Analytic Scaling**: Predicted broadening consistent with simulations, validating the dynamical constraint.
  - **Collisional Cascade Models**: Confirmed that **smaller bodies (R < 300 km)** can sustain the observed dust without excessive scattering.

- **Quantitative Results**:
  | Parameter          | Constraint                     |
  |--------------------|--------------------------------|
  | **Largest body radius (R_max)** | 5–300 km (0.005–0.3 R_Pluto) |
  | **Disc mass (M_disc)**       | ≤ few × 100 M⊕              |
  | **Disc broadening timescale** | Must exceed 440 Myr          |
