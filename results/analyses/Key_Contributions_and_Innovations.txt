Question:
What are the main contributions or innovations presented in this research?

Answer:
The **main contributions and innovations** of this research (from *2510.07187v1*) are:

1. **Dynamic Constraints on Debris-Disc Masses and Body Sizes**:
   - Introduces a **new method** to dynamically constrain the **total mass** of debris discs and the **size of their largest bodies**—two critical but poorly understood parameters in debris-disc science.

2. **Refutation of Primordial Pluto-Sized Dominance**:
   - Demonstrates that **Pluto-sized bodies cannot dominate the mass** of bright debris discs (e.g., Fomalhaut’s) if they formed early (primordially). Such large bodies would gravitationally scatter over time, broadening the disc beyond observed limits.

3. **Robustness to Model Assumptions**:
   - Shows that conclusions hold even under extreme variations in key parameters (e.g., size distribution slope *qₚ*, collisional strength *s*), making the findings **model-independent**.

4. **Alternative Scenarios Tested**:
   - Rules out mechanisms like **shepherding planets, collisional damping, or gas drag** as explanations for maintaining narrow discs, reinforcing that **smaller bodies (≤100 km) must dominate** the mass.

5. **Implications for Debris-Disc Evolution**:
   - Provides **independent evidence** that bright discs are likely dominated by **smaller planetesimals** (not large primordial bodies), aligning with collisional replenishment theories but challenging assumptions about primordial mass distributions.

**Key Takeaway**: The study offers a **novel dynamical framework** to infer unseen properties of debris discs, with broad implications for understanding planetesimal populations around other stars.
