Question:
What is this research paper about? Provide a clear summary.

Answer:
This research paper (***"Fomalhaut’s debris disc is not dominated by primordial Plutos"*** by Pearce et al., 2023) investigates the **mass and size distribution of large bodies in narrow debris discs**, focusing on **Fomalhaut’s debris ring**. The key challenge is that observations can only detect small dust grains, while the **mass-dominating planetesimals (km-sized or larger) remain unseen**. The study uses **dynamical constraints** (via *N*-body simulations and collisional theory) to infer limits on the sizes and masses of these hidden bodies.

### **Key Findings & Summary:**
1. **Problem Addressed:**
   - Debris discs (like Fomalhaut’s) appear **narrow and eccentric**, but if they contained **too many large bodies (e.g., Pluto-sized)**, gravitational scattering would **broaden the disc** over time—contradicting observations.
   - The **size distribution** of primordial bodies (left over from planet formation) is uncertain. If large bodies (e.g., Plutos) dominated the mass, the disc would not stay narrow.

2. **Methodology:**
   - **N-body simulations** tested how discs evolve under different **mass and body-size assumptions**.
   - Found a **clear threshold**: Discs with **too much mass or too-large bodies** scatter into broader structures **much faster than Fomalhaut’s age (440 Myr)**.
   - Only discs with **smaller primordial bodies** (radii **<300 km**, or **<1% Pluto’s mass**) maintain their observed narrow shape.

3. **Main Conclusions:**
   - **Primordial Plutos cannot dominate Fomalhaut’s disc mass**—their gravitational scattering would have broadened the disc by now.
   - If large bodies *do* exist, they must be **<300 km in radius** (likely **5–300 km**), meaning the disc’s mass is dominated by **smaller planetesimals**.
   - Alternative explanations (e.g., **shepherding planets, collisional damping, or recent formation**) were tested but **did not change the core result**.

4. **Broader Implications:**
   - Provides a **new dynamical method** to constrain **hidden mass and body sizes** in debris discs.
   - Supports the idea that **bright debris discs** (like Fomalhaut’s) are **not dominated by large primordial bodies** but by **smaller, unseen planetesimals**.

### **In Short:**
The paper rules out **Pluto-sized bodies as the dominant mass component** in Fomalhaut’s debris disc, showing that **smaller bodies (5–300 km radii) must dominate** to explain its narrow, stable structure over 440 million years. This offers a **novel way to indirectly measure unseen planetesimal populations** in debris discs.
