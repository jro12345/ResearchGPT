Question:
What do we know about pluto based on this paper?

Answer:
Based on the provided paper (**2510.07187v1**), here’s what we know about **Pluto** in the context of debris discs (like Fomalhaut’s):

1. **Size Constraints for Primordial Bodies**:
   - If a debris disc’s mass is dominated by primordial bodies (like those in the Kuiper Belt), they must be **smaller than ~300 km** (about **0.3 × Pluto’s radius**) to avoid self-scattering and broadening the disc.
   - The lower size limit is **~5–20 km** (with uncertainties). These bodies would each have **<1% of Pluto’s mass**.

2. **Pluto-Like Bodies Are Unlikely to Dominate**:
   - The paper argues that **Pluto-sized bodies (~1,188 km radius) cannot dominate the mass** of narrow debris discs (e.g., Fomalhaut’s). If they did, their gravitational interactions would widen the disc beyond observed limits.
   - Even a **single embedded Pluto** would excite the disc’s dynamics; multiple Plutos would amplify this effect, requiring smaller bodies to dominate the mass to keep the disc narrow.

3. **Survival of Icy Bodies**:
   - Primordial icy bodies with radii **>250 km** (e.g., Pluto-sized) could survive indefinitely in such discs, but their presence in large numbers would conflict with the observed narrow structure.
   - Smaller icy bodies (radii **>7–40 km**, depending on disc mass) might also survive, but the paper focuses on ruling out Pluto-scale dominance.

4. **Broader Implications**:
   - The findings **challenge prior mass estimates** of debris discs, which often assumed Pluto-sized bodies dominated. Instead, the data suggests **smaller planetesimals** (sub-Pluto-sized) are more plausible.
   - This aligns with the **"debris-disc mass problem"**: Extrapolating dust observations to assume large bodies (like Plutos) leads to unrealistically high disc masses (>1,000 Earth masses in some cases).

### Key Takeaway:
The paper **dynamically rules out Pluto-sized bodies as the dominant mass component** in narrow debris discs like Fomalhaut’s, favoring smaller bodies (**<300 km radius**) to explain the observed structure. Pluto itself is used as a **reference scale** to constrain the maximum size of primordial objects in these systems.
