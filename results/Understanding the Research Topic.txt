This research paper (***"Fomalhaut’s debris disc is not dominated by primordial Plutos"*** by Pearce et al., 2023) investigates the **mass and size distribution of large bodies in narrow debris discs**, focusing on **Fomalhaut’s debris ring**. The key challenge is that while observations detect small dust grains, the **mass-dominating planetesimals (kilometer-sized or larger) remain unseen**, requiring indirect dynamical constraints.

### **Core Findings & Methodology:**
1. **Problem Addressed**:
   - Debris discs like Fomalhaut’s are **narrow and eccentric**, but if they contained **large primordial bodies (e.g., Pluto-sized objects)**, gravitational scattering would **broaden the disc** over time—contradicting observations.
   - The paper tests whether **Pluto-sized bodies (or larger)** could dominate the disc’s mass without disrupting its observed structure.

2. **Key Approach**:
   - **N-body simulations** of debris discs with varying **total mass** and **largest body sizes** to see if they remain narrow over Fomalhaut’s **440-million-year age**.
   - **Result**: Discs with **too much mass or too-large bodies** scatter into broader structures (incompatible with observations), while **low-mass discs with smaller bodies** stay narrow.

3. **Main Conclusions**:
   - **Primordial Plutos cannot dominate Fomalhaut’s disc mass**—their gravitational scattering would have widened the disc long ago.
   - If the disc’s mass **is** dominated by primordial bodies, they must be:
     - **Smaller than ~300 km** (≈0.3 × Pluto’s radius, or **<1% Pluto’s mass**).
     - **Larger than ~5–20 km** (to avoid collisional grinding).
   - **Alternative scenarios** (e.g., recent Pluto formation, shepherding planets, collisional damping) were tested but **did not change the core conclusion**.

4. **Broader Implications**:
   - Provides a **new dynamical method** to constrain **hidden mass and largest body sizes** in debris discs.
   - Supports the idea that **bright debris discs are dominated by sub-Pluto-sized objects**, not giant primordial planetesimals.
   - Challenges assumptions that **large bodies (like Pluto or Eris) hold most of the mass** in debris systems.

### **Summary in One Sentence**:
The study **rules out Pluto-sized bodies as the dominant mass component in Fomalhaut’s debris disc**, showing that such large objects would gravitationally disrupt the disc’s narrow structure, and instead argues that the mass must be held by **smaller (5–300 km) primordial bodies**.
