Question 1:
What are the key morphological and compositional characteristics of Fomalhaut’s
debris disc (e.g., eccentricity, dust grain properties, and spatial asymmetries)
as inferred from multi-wavelength observations, and how do these differ from
other well-studied debris discs like β Pictoris or AU Microscopii?

Answer:
### **Step-by-Step Analysis of Fomalhaut’s Debris Disc Characteristics**  ---
### **1. Understanding the Research Question** The question asks for: - **Key
morphological and compositional characteristics** of Fomalhaut’s debris disc
(e.g., eccentricity, dust grain properties, spatial asymmetries). - **How these
differ** from other well-studied debris discs (β Pictoris, AU Microscopii). -
**Inferences from multi-wavelength observations** (e.g., ALMA, HST, JWST).
**Key components to address:** - **Morphology:** Shape (narrow vs. broad),
eccentricity, asymmetries. - **Composition:** Dust grain sizes, planetesimal
size distribution, mass constraints. - **Dynamical constraints:** Self-
scattering, shepherding planets, collisional evolution. - **Comparative
analysis:** Contrast with β Pic and AU Mic.  ---  ### **2. Extracting Key
Information from the Papers** *(Sources 1–8 are from Pearce et al. 2025,
arXiv:2510.07187v1)*  #### **A. Morphological Characteristics** - **Narrow and
eccentric disc:**   - Fomalhaut’s disc is **narrow** (width ~12–19 AU, resolved
by ALMA/HST/JWST) with a **global eccentricity of ~0.1** (Source 6).   - The
disc’s **width is constrained by observations** (ALMA beam: ~8.9–12 AU
minor/major axis). If the disc broadened by >1.5×, it would be detectable
(Source 5).   - **Asymmetries:** Not explicitly mentioned, but dynamical models
suggest the disc’s narrowness implies **limited self-scattering** (Sources 2,
7).  - **Comparison to β Pic and AU Mic:**   - **β Pictoris:** Wider, more
extended disc (~100 AU radius), with a prominent warp and asymmetries (e.g.,
clumps, secondary disc). Eccentricity is lower (~0.05–0.1).   - **AU
Microscopii:** Edge-on, highly asymmetric (vertical structures, "fast-moving
waves"), with significant dust clumps and a wider spread (~200 AU). Eccentricity
is near-zero but with strong vertical perturbations.  #### **B. Compositional
Characteristics** - **Dust grain properties:**   - Observations detect **dust
grains ≤ few cm** (Source 1). Larger grains are inferred indirectly.   -
**Multi-wavelength observations** (HST: scattered light; ALMA: mm emission;
JWST: IR) probe different grain sizes:     - **Scattered light (HST/JWST):**
Sensitive to **micron-sized grains** (high albedo, short lifetimes).     -
**ALMA (mm):** Probes **mm-cm grains** (longer lifetimes, collisional
replenishment required).   - **Temperature-dependent emission:** Grains are
treated as blackbodies with \( T \propto r^{-1/2} \) (Source 8).  -
**Planetesimal size distribution:**   - **Key constraint:** The disc **cannot be
dominated by Pluto-sized (~1000 km) bodies**, as they would **self-scatter** and
broaden the disc beyond observations (Sources 2, 5, 7).   - **Allowed
planetesimal sizes:**     - **Upper limit:** \( r < 300 \pm 80 \) km (~0.3 \(
R_{\text{Pluto}} \)).     - **Lower limit:** \( r > 5^{+20}_{-4} \) km (to avoid
excessive collisional grinding).   - **Mass constraints:**     - Total disc mass
is **not dominated by primordial Plutos** but by **smaller planetesimals**
(Sources 2, 4).     - Previous mass estimates (extrapolating from dust mass) are
**unreliable** due to unknown size distributions (Source 1).  - **Comparison to
β Pic and AU Mic:**   - **β Pic:** Evidence for **large planetesimals** (e.g.,
falling evaporating bodies, "FEBs"; Lagrange et al. 2019). Disc mass may include
**km-to-100 km bodies** (e.g., Wyatt & Dent 2002).   - **AU Mic:** **High
collisional activity** (frequent dust replenishment), suggesting a **steep size
distribution** (small grains dominate; e.g., Strubbe & Chiang 2006).  #### **C.
