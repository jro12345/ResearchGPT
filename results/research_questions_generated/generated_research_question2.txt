Question 2:
How have high-resolution imaging techniques (e.g., ALMA, JWST, or HST) been
employed to characterize the structure, dust grain properties, and potential
embedded planetesimals in Fomalhaut’s debris disc, and what are the
methodological limitations of these approaches?

Answer:
### **Step-by-Step Analysis of the Research Question**  ---  ### **1.
Understanding the Research Question** The question asks how **high-resolution
imaging techniques** (ALMA, JWST, HST) have been used to study **Fomalhaut’s
debris disc**, focusing on: - **Structure** (e.g., width, eccentricity, gaps) -
**Dust grain properties** (e.g., size distribution, dynamics, interaction with
gas) - **Embedded planetesimals** (e.g., constraints on their sizes/masses) -
**Methodological limitations** of these approaches.  **Key sub-questions:** -
What observational data do these telescopes provide? - How are dynamical models
(e.g., *N*-body simulations) combined with observations? - What are the physical
constraints derived from these studies? - Where do uncertainties or limitations
arise?  ---  ### **2. Extracting Relevant Information from the Sources** Below
is a structured summary of the key points from the provided excerpts (all from
**pearce2025, arXiv:2510.07187v1**):  #### **A. Observational Techniques &
Data** - **Telescopes used:**   - **HST (Hubble Space Telescope):** Resolved the
disc’s **global eccentricity (e ≈ 0.1)** and narrow structure (Kalas et al.
2013).   - **ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array):** Provided **high-resolution
1.3 mm images** of the disc, revealing its **sharp edges** and **width**
(MacGregor et al. 2017).   - **JWST (James Webb Space Telescope):** Observed
**10 µm dust grains** via thermal emission, confirming the disc’s **gas-free
dynamics** (Gáspár et al. 2023; Sommer et al. 2025).  - **Key observational
features:**   - The disc is **narrow** (width constrained by ALMA’s beam).   -
**No significant millimeter emission outside the ring**, implying little dust
beyond the main belt.   - **10 µm grains** (observed by JWST) match predictions
from **gas-free Poynting-Robertson drag models**.  #### **B. Structural
Characterization** - **Disc width & eccentricity:**   - The disc’s
**narrowness** (FWHM from Gaussian fits) is used to constrain **dynamical
scattering** (Source 6).   - **Eccentricity (e ≈ 0.1)** suggests gravitational
perturbations (possibly from an unseen planet or stellar flybys). - **Gaps &
asymmetries:**   - No explicit gaps are mentioned, but the **sharp edges**
(ALMA) suggest **confined planetesimals** or **shepherding by a planet**.  ####
**C. Dust Grain Properties** - **Size distribution:**   - **Millimeter grains
(1.3 mm, ALMA):** Short-lived due to **collisional destruction** (lifetime ~1
Myr; Source 4).   - **10 µm grains (JWST):** Inward migration via **Poynting-
Robertson drag**; profile matches **gas-free models** (Source 7). - **Gas-dust
interactions:**   - **Epstein drag regime** (Source 4): Dust-gas interactions
are weak (mean free path >> grain size).   - **No evidence for gas confinement**
(Source 7): Observed 10 µm grains are inconsistent with gas drag models.  ####
**D. Embedded Planetesimals** - **Constraints on sizes/masses:**   -
**Primordial Plutos (1000 km bodies) are ruled out** (Sources 2, 3, 8):     - If
large bodies dominated, **self-scattering** would broaden the disc beyond
observed limits.     - *N*-body simulations show the disc would **disperse in
<10 Myr** if dominated by >100 km bodies.   - **Maximum planetesimal size likely
≤ few km** (Source 3):     - Larger bodies would require implausibly high disc
masses (>1000 M⊕, exceeding protoplanetary disc inheritance). - **Dynamical
methods:**   - **Secular effects & planet migration** (Source 1): Used to infer
disc masses from gaps or eccentricities.   - **Vertical structure** (Source 1):
Inclined planets could constrain disc mass via warps.  #### **E. Methodological
Limitations** 1. **Model dependencies:**    - *N*-body simulations assume
**idealized initial conditions** (e.g., no gas
