Question 3:
What evidence exists from spectroscopic and polarimetric studies to support or
refute the hypothesis that the observed dust in Fomalhautâ€™s disc is primarily
produced by recent collisional cascades rather than primordial grain survival,
and what are the estimated timescales for these processes?
