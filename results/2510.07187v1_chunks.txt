and body sizes. this paper presents a new method, applicable to narrow debris discs like fomalhaut. we argue that such discs cannot be too massive, nor the largest bodies too large, otherwise they would self-scatter and the disc would be much broader than observed. using𝑛-bodydynamicsandcollisionaltheory, wedemonstratethatthemassoffomalhaut sdisccannotbedominated by primordial plutos. instead, if the mass is dominated by primordial bodies, then they should have radii below300 80 70km (0. 3 0. 1 r pluto) and above5 20 4km. such bodies would each have less than1 per centthe mass of pluto. our conclusions are robusttoadditionalphysics, includingshepherdingplanetsandcollisionaldamping. ourresultsprovideindependent, dynamical support for the idea that the masses of bright debris discs are dominated by objects smaller than pluto.

the brightest extrasolar discs would have extrapolated masses ex- ceeding1000 m (krivovetal. 2018). thesevaluesareimplausibly high, because they exceed the total solid content thought to be in- heritable from protoplanetary discs. the most probable solution is that the brightest debris discs comprise bodies no larger than a few kilometres, which is much smaller than the1000 kmradius of pluto (krivov wyatt 2021). however, this has not been independently proven. toproceed, thecommunityneedsdirectmeasurementsofdebris- discmassesandlargest-bodysizes, whichdonotrelyonextrapolated dustmasses. thereisnosinglemethodforeverydisc;instead, there are multiple potential methods, each applicable to a subset of discs. herewepresentanewmethod, applicabletonarrowdiscslikefoma- lhaut. theideaisthatneitherthediscmass, northesizeofthelargest debris, canbetoolarge, orthediscwouldscatteritselfapart.

os could be embedded in fomalhaut s disc, but the disc mass must be dominated by smaller bodies. 5. 4 omitting planetesimal growth we demonstrated that fomalhaut s primordial disc was not domi- nated by plutos, otherwise it would have broadened by now. how- ever, it is possible that planetesimals continued to merge and grow after the protoplanetary disc dissipated, with plutos forming much morerecently. inthiscase, theyoungerplutosmightnotyethavehad time to disrupt the disc, so whilst no plutos were in the primordial disc, they could be present today. totestthis, werearrangeequation 5fortime𝑡, andset𝑠 1 r pluto and𝑚 disc, 0 9 2 m (the latter from equation 8). this yields the maximumagethatplutoscanhavewithouthavingdisruptedthedisc, which is100 100 myr. so given the440 40 myrof fomalhaut, ifplutos dominatethedisctoday, thentheymusthavetakenatleast 300 myrto form.

--- Chunk 64 ---
osexistedin the primordial debris disc, they have since formed and will disrupt the disc in future. in a broader context: collisional models of debris discs typi- cally assume the size distribution evolves with time at intermedi- atesizes( 𝑠 km(𝑡)), asprogressivelylargerbodiesenterthecascade (e. g. löhne et al. 2008; krivov wyatt 2021). however, if dwarf-planet formation is also ongoing, then the upper end of the distri- bution should simultaneously evolve away from a primordial slope as larger bodies grow. there should therefore be a size where the cascadetransitionsfromeitherdestruction-orprimordial-dominated to growth-dominated. this could be factored into future models, as it has implications for the total disc mass and the self-stirring level. 5. 5 gas drag another possibility is that primordial plutosarepresent in the nar- row ring, but that this ring is prevented from spreading by gas drag.

--- Chunk 65 ---
plutosarepresent in the nar- row ring, but that this ring is prevented from spreading by gas drag. this seems unlikely, because the observed-gas content of the foma- lhaut ring is low, especially compared to other a stars (matrà et al. 2017;hughesetal. 2018). totestthis, weconsidertwopossibilities; either gas confines planetesimals to a narrow ring, or gas confines observed millimetre dust, whilst unseen planetesimals have a wider distribution. totestthefirstpossibility, weconsiderplanetesimalsinanarrow, eccentricgasdisc. theseplanetesimalswouldinteractwithgasinthe stokesdragregime, withacceleration r v rel vrel(wherev relisthe planetesimal svelocityrelativetothegas). beaugéetal.

ar longer than fomalhaut s4. 4 108yrage. these timescales are even longer for larger planetesimals. there could be more gas in other, undetectedspecies, butequation 19showsthatatleast100 m of gas would be needed to damp planetesimals within fomalhaut s age. assuming the unseen gas is predominantly h 2, this requires a co h 2abundance ratio of at most10 7, which is much lower than typical ism values of10 4(e. g. kóspál et al. 2013; matrà et al. 2015). hence it seems unlikely that fomalhaut s planetesimals are confined to a narrow ring by gas. the second possibility is that the planetesimal belt is wider than the observed millimetre belt, but that the millimetre dust is con- fined by a narrow ring of gas. for plausible gas quantities in the fomalhaut disc, the mean-free path of gas molecules is much larger than1 mm, regardless of gas species.

--- Chunk 68 ---
lhaut disc, the mean-free path of gas molecules is much larger than1 mm, regardless of gas species. this means that dust inter- acts with gas in the epstein drag regime, with an acceleration of either r v relor v rel vrelif the grain is subsonic or supersonic respectively (e. g. kwok 1975; armitage 2010; pearce et al. 2020). for simplicity we assume the grain is supersonic, to drive maximal damping. inthiscase r v rel vrelandwecanagainusethebeaugé etal.

--- Chunk 70 ---
, yet their profile is well-explained by a gas-free model (gáspár et al. 2023; sommer et al. 2025). we therefore find it unlikely that gas maintains fomalhaut s narrow ring in the face of dynamical spread- ing, by either confining planetesimals or dust, so we do not believe that gas affects our overall conclusions. 5. 6 shepherding planets a final possibility is that the fomalhaut ring would broaden by it- self, but is prevented from doing so by shepherding planets. in this mechanism, planets exert secular torques that repel the ring, so the combined effect of two planets either side of the ring is to confine planetesimals to a narrow range of semimajor axes (e. g. murray dermott 1999). goldreich tremaine (1979) first proposed shepherding to ex- plain narrow rings of uranus, which would otherwise broaden throughcollisions.

--- Chunk 72 ---
timescale from equation 20 should be at most the broadening timescale from our earlier simulations. to test this, we run new𝑛-body simulations of the fomalhaut disc plus two shepherding planets. the planets are equal mass, one on either side of the disc, and on coplanar orbits apsidally aligned with the disc. we consider the disc parameters from figure 2: a 30 m disccomprisingbodiesofradius1. 9 r pluto, whichour𝑛-body simulations show would broaden over 20 myrif not shepherded. we run this simulation three more times, each time including two equal-massplanetsofmass0. 7, 0. 2or0. 07 m jup(200, 70and20 m respectively), where0. 7 m jupis the3𝜎upper limit near the disc fromjwstnircam (ygouf et al. 2024). in each case the planets semimajor axes are calculated using equation 20, with𝑡 shepset to 20 myr. we set the inner planet s eccentricity to 0. 2.

(2012) did notencounterthisproblemintheirshepherdingsimulations, because they simulated planets interacting with a massless disc. whilst we do not conduct a thorough exploration, our simulations suggest that shepherdingisdifficulttoachieveinpractise.

uct a thorough exploration, our simulations suggest that shepherdingisdifficulttoachieveinpractise. wethereforebelieveit unlikely that fomalhaut s disc contains primordial plutos, which is prevented from broadening by unseen shepherding planets. 6 discussion: wider impact we used a new method to show that fomalhaut s disc mass cannot be dominated by primordial plutos and that, if plutos are present, they must have formed recently. this study has wider implications for several areas of debris science, beyond fomalhaut alone. first, our conclusion backs up the argument of krivov wyatt (2021), that planetesimals are born small in the brightest debris discs. they argue that the largest bodies must be small, because ex- trapolating observed dust up to unseen plutos would mean that the brightestdebrisdiscshavemassesabove1000 m, whichwouldvi- olateourunderstandingofprotoplanetarydiscs(krivovetal. 2018).

--- Chunk 80 ---
hen bodies would scatter each other, resulting in a significantly broader disc than observed today. our main conclusions are: (i) primordial plutos do not dominate the mass of fomalhaut s debris disc. (ii) the only way that plutos could dominate is if they formed recently, within the last150 myr(compared to the440 myrage of fomalhaut). (iii) the only way for primordial plutos to exist in the disc today is if 100 kmbodies dominate the disc mass. we investigate many alternative scenarios to maintain the narrow disc, including shepherding planets, collisional damping and gas drag, but find that the above conclusions are robust. our paper presents a new method for dynamically constraining debris-discmassesandlargest-bodysizes, bothofwhicharekeyun- knowns. it provides a new, independent argument that the brightest discscannotbedominatedbylargeprimordialbodies.
